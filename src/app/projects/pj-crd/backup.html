        <h3>Background of Web CRD</h3>
        <p>
          The 1980's. it was very hard to register as a broker. Each exchange and
          state government had different rules and procedures for registration. A
          large firm would need to submit dozens of different registration forms to
          register a single employee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The regulators got together and agreed on a uniform set of registration
          forms (Fun fact: the "U" in U4, U5, etc. stands for "uniform"). Better
          yet, in 1999, FINRA (then NASD) launched a website (WebCRD) which was a
          registration "one stop shop". This was a huge win for the industry. Since
          then the world kept changing and CRD kept busy adapting to the changes.

        <p>
          Nowadays, as users increasly expect enterprise/work applications to be
          intuitive and more like applications they use in their personal lives ,
          users expect information to be readily available and easier to consume so
          they can perform their activities more efficiently. A redesign of the CRD
          is coming on to the roadmap.
        </p>
        <p>Some feedback received regarding the existing system includes</p>
        <ul class="circle">
          <li>
            Tired of maintaining paper copies of filings and getting ink signatures
          </li>
          <li>CRD requires extensive training to use. Not intuitive</li>
          <li>
            It’s not obvious which information in CRD should be of heightened
            concern
          </li>
          <li>
            It’s difficult to manage all of the compliance tasks. Must check several
            areas of CRD
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h3>Goal of Redesign</h3>
        <p>Given the context above, the goal of our redesign is to:</p>
        <ul class="square">
          <li>
            Create a registration & licensing system that encourages information
            sharing and makes it easier for the industry to meet its registration &
            compliance obligations
          </li>
          <li>
            Lay the foundation for an efficient, risk-based, and data-driven
            disclosure and regulatory review program for regulators.
          </li>
          <li>
            Curate customized user experience to provide a more modern site
            experience to our users that makes it easy for them to do their work,
            allow users to customize their views e.g. An Examiner’s objective for
            using CRD varies from a RAD Disclosure Review staff’s use of CRD, pursue
            the notion of a portal experience – Firm access via Firm Gateway; FINRA
            access via Enterprise desktop etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Problems to be Solved</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most important tasks we try to resolve through new platform is
          to keep firm users updated with their activities requiring their
          attention. Highlight activities needing scrutiny. allow firms to
          filter/sort/export/manage tasks based on customized needs. Nowadays, It’s
          not obvious which information in CRD should be of heightened
          concernDifficult to manage all of the compliance tasks. Must check several
          areas of CRD(queues/reports/notifications)
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, most of the in-system communication are handled via email, mail
          and phone calls including responding to document requests electronically.
          Working with FINRA on a disclosure often requires an interaction which is
          longer than a single CRD event.We target at having all communication be
          done through the system, both for review simplicity and for historical
          reference

        <h3>Design Challenges</h3>
        <h4>UI Challenge - Movable Piece</h4>
        <p>
          It has been discussed intensively regarding whether allowing users to drag
          and drop to customize their dashboard interface is necessary configuration
          of our platform. Feature of such has been applied to many FINRA systems
          and widely accepted by management as a common knowledge. However, through
          a couple of user interviews, we learned that most novice users doesn’t
          realize they can customize the UI due to lacking of visual indicator. From
          conversation with engineers we learned it is challenging to build such
          components that could scale easily. We start rethinking about the
          necessity of having this feature. After conducting some (comparative
          analysis)…. With similar enterprise level products, such as ... , we
          noticed less movable pieces being used in system design nowadays. Probably
          because the visual hint is so subtle to notice, and the strategy of
          allowing users to restore their previous setting would be a even bigger
          challenge. A good design usually doesn't require change of views very
          often, e,g. … I believe Movable pieces is great for expert user but not so
          friendly for beginners who are just started with the system. Once expert
          users get their customized view configured, they are less likely to use
          feature of such to modify the view either. Since the new web CRD is
          targeting at lower entrance barrier and flatten learning curve, building a
          generic usable dashboard rather than a configurable one should be our main
          focus.
        </p>
        <h4>Discussion around saved filters option</h4>
        <p>
          Numerous discussion has been undertaken regarding the appropriate set up
          of filters. At first it is straightforward that clicking on filter button
          would reveal the filter panel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hassles come in when “save filter” feature kicks in, as well as the option
          to apply an existing saved filter and update the current filter. This
          complicates the flow with far more requirements as when user trigger the
          filter, the UI need to clearly indicate if it is a saved one, if it has
          been modified, if the modified changes has been applied and how to rename
          this filter.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/img/res/crd/filterflow1.png" alt="Filter Option 1" />
        <h4>Option 1</h4>
        <p>
          The initial solution we had was to have the save filter feature inside the
          filters panel, as they are considered
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Detail Improvements: </b> Naming the new filter was a modal popup, that
          get changed into a field level update in later revisions to preserve the
          context action took place.
        </p>
    
        <img src="assets/img/res/crd/filterflow2.png" alt="Filter Option 2" />
        <h4>Option 2</h4>
        <p>
          We received some criticism during internal review for the access to saved
          filter is buried too deep, that it takes one extra click to open. Also the
          display of having dropdown control on top of panel yielded too many
          layers.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we came up with another version with saved filters moved up on
          hierarchy. The logic behind such design choice being filters and filter
          options are under the same logic group, “saved filters” are the controls
          on top of filter settings.
        </p>
    
        <img src="assets/img/res/crd/filterflow3.1.png" alt="Filter Option 3" />
        <h4>Option 3</h4>
        <p>
          The design looks very good by mockup but was quickly falling down in later
          useability testing. As users were asked how would they save a filter or
          apply a filter that has been saved already, majority of them tend to look
          for options inside filter panel and ignore the “saved filter” text there
          right at their face. The reason for that was partly because two controls
          could be far away from each other on wide display that users can’t easily
          draw connections between the two.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Final Design Solution</h2>
        <p>
          At last, we came up with this composite design that balance the
          expectations from all parties. In this revision, not only we moved “save
          filter” and “filter” options close to each other, but also keep both of
          them visible when panel is revealed, not giving users a single chance to
          miss them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond that, this flow perfectly solved dilemma of multiple layering on UI
          as the overlay/confirmation modal from deletion is visually separated from
          the panel.

        <h3>Impact of New CRD</h3>
        <p>
          This new and improved CRD will benefit everyone involved - The industry,
          FINRA and other regulators. Return on investment could be measured in
          terms of the significant time and cost savings for firms in the
          efficiencies gained with the improved channels of communications and ease
          of reporting with the new interfaces. Allowing firms to achieve greater
          levels of compliance at reduced costs, by lowering learning curves or
          reducing missed filings or deadlines that could otherwise result in costly
          penalties. Similarly, FINRA and other regulators benefit because there are
          efficiencies gained by not spending time and labour on manual processes
          but are freed to use them instead in more effective ways to monitor firms,
          providing savings that go beyond budget line items.
